# Analizing Data with Python
## Overview
This folder contains some code developed as exercise during the course (ML0101EN) Machine Learning with Python: A Practical Introduction by IBM at edX.
The codes developed here were **not** developed by me from beginning to end, but completed with the intention of fix the knowledge adquired and developed.
