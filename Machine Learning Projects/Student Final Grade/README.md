# Student Final Grade
## Overview
This folder contain a machine learning project to predict the final grade of a student given various individual conditions.
The features are described in the student.txt file located at the folder.

## Motivation
The data contains features that may be relevent or not to the success of the student.

Due to the number of features and low correlation between the predictor variable and target variable would be complicate to evaluate feature by feature until find the
most relevant ones. The code automates the search passing a grid search to the best polynomial degree and parameters that predicts the GPA with the lower error.
